# InstantSlackBot
Simple, extensible, multithreaded Slack Bot Ruby API 
- Lightweight and largely transparent layer on top of Slack APIs
- Simple, intuitive and familiar Ruby API
- Fully multithreaded for efficient and fast response
- Supports multiple bots per instance
- Each Bot is composed of one or more conditions and one action
- Conditions can be Strings, Regexps, Procs or Methods
- Actions are based on Strings, Procs or Methods
- Inherit the Bot class for the most flexible Bot creation
- Uses the Slack Web RPC API to post and transfer metadata
- Uses the Slack RTM API to receive messages in realtime
- Optionally use the Slack RTM API to send messages with low latency

InstantSlackBot can be created and run in as little as one line.
```ruby
InstantSlackBot::Master.new(token: token, bots: { conditions: 'hi', action: 'Hello!' }).run
```

By passing Procs or Methods for conditions and actions, more [sophisticated bots can easily be made](examples).

####How does it work?
* Create a **InstantSlackBot::Master** instance to communicate with the Slack API - you can 
[get an API token here](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens).
* Create at least one **InstantSlackBot::Bot**. Each Bot needs at least one condition and an action.
* **conditions** determine when the Bot responds and can be as simple as a text string or 
  regular expression which is matched against each message, or Procs/Methods for more sophisticated logic.
* Multiple conditions can matched with boolean **and** or **or** logic (**or** is the default).
* An **action** forms the response when the conditions are met. An action can be as simple as a text string, but 
will usually be a Proc or Method.
* When using Procs or Methods for conditions or actions, an hash argument will pass the received message and extra details.
* For the most flexibility, inherit the Bot class and override the #conditions and #action methods (see [class-example](https://github.com/robzr/instant-slack-bot/blob/master/examples/class-bot)).
* Finally, register the Bots with the Master and call **Master#run** to begin operation.

####TODO
* Make inheritence of Master#options consistent for all Bot#options (ex: :use_api)
* Add ResponseCache class - based on identical input, cache with time/hit count/size expire
* Add AutoLoader class - monitors directory, adds & removes methods based on files
* Update API documentation to RDoc standards
* Bundle and distribute on rubygems.org

###License & Credits
* The InstantSlackBot::SlackRTM class is based on [RÃ©mi Delhaye's slack-rtm-api gem](https://github.com/rdlh/slack-rtm-api)
